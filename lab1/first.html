	A <em>Red Cap</em> or <em>Redcap</em> (also known as a powrie or dunter) is a type of malevolent murderous <i>dwarf</i> in English and Scottish Folklore.
	<br/>
	They are said to inhabit ruined castles found along the border between <em>England</em> and <em>Scotland</em>.
	<br/>
	Myths & Legends
	<br/>
<em>Redcaps</em> are said to murder travellers who stray into their homes and dye their hats with their victims' blood (from which they get their name).<br/>
<em>Redcaps</em> must kill regularly, for if the blood staining their hats dries out, they die. <em>Redcaps</em> are very fast in spite of the heavy iron pikes they wield and the iron-shod boots they wear. Outrunning a redcap is supposedly impossible.
<br/>
Appearance
<br/>
<em>Redcap</em> is depicted as "a short, thickset old man with long prominent teeth, skinny fingers armed with talons like eagles, large eyes of a fiery <mark>red</mark> colour, grisly hair streaming down his shoulders, iron boots, a pikestaff in his left hand, and a <mark>red</mark> cap on his head".

Grantully Castle
<br/>
There is a tale of one in <em>Perthshire</em> which is more benign; living in a room in <em>Grantully Castle</em>, he bestows good fortune on those who see or hear him.
<br/>
Dutch Variation
<br/>
The <em>Kabouter</em>, or <em>redcaps</em> of Dutch folklore, are very different, and more akin to brownies.<br/>
