	A <strong>Red Cap</strong> or <strong>Redcap</strong> (also known as a powrie or dunter) is a type of malevolent murderous <i>dwarf</i> in English and Scottish Folklore.
	<br/>
	They are said to inhabit ruined castles found along the border between <strong>England</strong> and <strong>Scotland</strong>.
	<br/>
	Myths & Legends
	<br/>
<strong>Redcaps</strong> are said to murder travellers who stray into their homes and dye their hats with their victims' blood (from which they get their name).<br/>
<strong>Redcaps</strong> must kill regularly, for if the blood staining their hats dries out, they die. <strong>Redcaps</strong> are very fast in spite of the heavy iron pikes they wield and the iron-shod boots they wear. Outrunning a redcap is supposedly impossible.
<br/>
Appearance
<br/>
<strong>Redcap</strong> is depicted as "a short, thickset old man with long prominent teeth, skinny fingers armed with talons like eagles, large eyes of a fiery <mark>red</mark> colour, grisly hair streaming down his shoulders, iron boots, a pikestaff in his left hand, and a <mark>red</mark> cap on his head".

Grantully Castle
<br/>
There is a tale of one in <strong>Perthshire</strong> which is more benign; living in a room in <strong>Grantully Castle</strong>, he bestows good fortune on those who see or hear him.
<br/>
Dutch Variation
<br/>
The <strong>Kabouter</strong>, or <strong>redcaps</strong> of Dutch folklore, are very different, and more akin to brownies.<br/>
